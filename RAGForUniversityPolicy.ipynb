      "The University's policy on protests and demonstrations aims to balance the right to free expression with the need to maintain a safe and functional environment for all members of the University community. Key aspects of the policy include:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Permissibility of Peaceful Protests:** Peaceful protests and orderly demonstrations are generally allowed.\n",
      "*   **Non-Disruption:** Protests cannot disrupt University operations, endanger safety, or infringe upon the rights and privileges of others. Disruptive conduct is defined as obstructing, impairing, or interfering with teaching, research, administration, authorized use of facilities, or the rights of other members of the community.\n",
      "*   **Compliance with Guidelines:** Participants must adhere to occupancy limits, building closures, noise level guidelines, and all other University regulations.\n",
      "*   **Signage:** Placards, banners, and signs are generally permitted but may be restricted if deemed dangerous or impeding participation.\n",
      "*   **Advance Arrangements:** Organizers are encouraged to make advance arrangements with University staff.\n",
      "*   **City Permits:** For events on city sidewalks and streets, students are responsible for acquiring city permits and adhering to city ordinances.\n",
      "*   **University Authority to End Protests:** University officials have the authority to end a protest if they determine that University operations (especially instruction and research) have been compromised or the rights of others have been significantly infringed.\n",
      "*   **Counter-Protests:** Counter-protestors cannot deprive others from participating in an activity or event. A separate protest area may be designated for those with differing views.\n",
      "*   **Identification:** Participants must provide identification upon request.\n",
      "*   **Safety:** Protests must maintain a physically safe environment for all. Occupancy limits of the protest area must be adhered to. Walkways and entrances to buildings must remain open to allow safe access and egress. A clearly designated pathway through the area must be maintained.\n",
      "*   **Consequences of Violation:** Violations of the policy may lead to disciplinary action, arrest, and prosecution.\n",
